SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PrtgXml is a wrapper library for creating PRTG EXE/Script Advanced Sensor XML output.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PrtgXml provides a series of functions that correspond to the XML tags found in
    EXE/Script Advanded Sensors. Each function takes one of two arguments:

        If the function corresponds to a tag that contains inner tag, a script block containing
        those tags.

        If the function corresponds to a take that takes a proper value, a literal or a variable
        containing that value.

            Channel "First channel"
